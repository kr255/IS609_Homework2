The world is constantly changing along with technology and the internet. The internet allows society to access information at any point of time, and is controlled by no one. The world as we know it cannot fathom a world without Google or the internet because it’s a part of our daily lives.

As a consumer we have what is called an “ID tag” that saves all of the most recent information we’ve searched and companies analyze that to make targeted recommendations.
